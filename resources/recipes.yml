# This is where you create Crafting Recipes for Custom Armor Sets.
# Due to some limitations, these do not show in the available recipes.
# However, they do show when the correct recipe is placed in the crafting table.
# In addition, some of the items properties like lore/name don't show correctly
# nor do the custom colors if a leather set is used.
# After crafting though, the item is correctly displayed.

# This is the name of the armor set. Use a - to separate this and the item name.
# In the below example, the recipe is to craft a leather helmet of the Example Custom Armor Set
Example-leather_helmet:
  # Consider this to be a 3x3 crafting grid.
  # Wherever A is mentioned, the material A must be present.
  # Wherever B is mentioned, the material B must be present.

  # Any number of materials can be added here.
